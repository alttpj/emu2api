= Compiling emu2api

== Prerequisites

* Java JDK 11 or higher. +
Best tested with OpenJDK-OpenJ9 builds from link:https://adoptium.net/[Eclipse Adoptium]. +
If you do not want to install another Java, you can just use the zip/tgz distribution, extract it somewhere and set `JAVA_HOME` in your current shell.
* Optional: Maven. +
You can also use the included maven wrapper script `./mvnw`.

== Compilation

To compile, enter:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify
----

This will run all standard tests, but skip long-runnin integration tests and generation of the documentation.

It will produce a jar artifact in `server/meecrowave/target/`.

== Compilation profiles

=== TOML / YAML

The default configuration will use YAML files.
You can switch to using TOML by using the System Property `-Dconfig.toml`.

*Note* that profile activation will not work here unless you explicitly deactivate the yaml profile: `'-Pconfig-toml,!config-yaml'`.
